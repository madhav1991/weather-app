This application calls the openweather API. For an input city that the user enters, it returns the current temparature of city.
The user has option to add multiple cities adn clear them.
Upon clicking each city, the 5 day weather forcasting is dislayed. The user has option to refresh the 5 Day weather forcasting.
I have used redux for state management.

The user also has an option to filter the restaurants based on address, name, etc.
